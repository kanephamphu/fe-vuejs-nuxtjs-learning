# Exercise: Style Master

- [x] I know that `:class` is shorthand for `v-bind:class`.
- [x] I understand how to use object syntax for classes.

? Which syntax is used to toggle a class based on a boolean? ! Object
? In `:style`, should you use kebab-case or camelCase? ! camelCase
? Can you bind both a static `class` and a dynamic `:class` on the same element? ! Yes

? Dynamic binding examples (Multiple Choice):
- [X] :class="{ active: true }"
- [X] :class="['a', 'b']"
- [X] :style="{ color: 'red' }"
- [ ] v-class="active"
