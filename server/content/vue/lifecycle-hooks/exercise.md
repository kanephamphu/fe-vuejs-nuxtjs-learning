# Exercise: Lifecycle Logic

- [x] I understand that `mounted` is the right place for API calls.
- [x] I know how to clean up resources in `unmounted`.

? Which hook is called when the component is added to the DOM? ! mounted
? Which hook is used to perform cleanup (e.g., clear intervals)? ! unmounted
? In Composition API, what is the equivalent of `mounted`? ! onMounted

? Lifecycle phases (Multiple Choice):
- [X] Creation
- [X] Mounting
- [X] Updates
- [X] Unmounting
- [ ] Deletion (it's unmounting)
