# Exercise: Reactivity Pro

- [x] I know when to use `ref` vs `reactive`.
- [x] I understand that `ref` needs `.value` in scripts.

? Which function requires `.value` to access its data in JavaScript? ! ref
? Can `reactive` be used with a primitive like a number? ! No
? Does a `ref` need `.value` inside a `<template>`? ! No

? Reactivity facts (Multiple Choice):
- [X] ref() works with primitives
- [X] reactive() only works with objects
- [X] template auto-unwraps refs
- [ ] ref() cannot hold an object
