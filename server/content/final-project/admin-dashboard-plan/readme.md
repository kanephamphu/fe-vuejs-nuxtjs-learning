# Final Project: The Platform Admin Dashboard

Congratulations! You have reached the final stage. Instead of building a generic "To-Do App" or "Weather Widget", you are going to build **The Management Interface for this very Learning Platform**.

## 1. The Scenario
You have been hired as the Lead Frontend Engineer for "CodeMastery". The CEO needs a dashboard to track how students are performing in the JavaScript, Vue, and Nuxt courses.

## 2. Core Requirements
Your dashboard must include the following features:

### A. The "Command Center" (Home)
- **KPI Cards**: Display Total Students, Total Lessons Completed, and Average Score.
- **Activity Feed**: A list of the most recent lessons completed by any user.

### B. User Management Table
- **Data Table**: A searchable, sortable list of all registered users.
- **Status Indicators**: Visual tags for "Active", "Idle", or "Completed".
- **Actions**: A "View Details" button for each user.

### C. Student Detail View
- **Progress Visualization**: A heatmap or chart showing this specific student's progress across modules.
- **Certificate Status**: A dynamic badge that unlocks when progress hits 100%.

## 3. Technical Stack (The "Premium" Touch)
- **Nuxt 3**: For SSR and file-based routing.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For a completely custom, responsive design (Dark Mode required!).
- **Pinia**: To manage the global admin state (e.g., current selected user).
- **Chart.js** (or similar): To render the progress bars and analytics.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is your portfolio piece. Treat it like a real job assignment. Focus on **Clean Code**, **Component Reusability**, and **Pixel-Perfect Design**.
