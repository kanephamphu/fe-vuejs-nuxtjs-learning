# Primitive Data Types
JavaScript has 7 primitive data types:

1. **String**: Sequence of characters. `"Hello"`, `'World'`.
2. **Number**: Integers and floating-point numbers. `42`, `3.14`.
3. **BigInt**: Integers with arbitrary precision. `9007199254740991n`.
4. **Boolean**: Logical entity. `true`, `false`.
5. **Undefined**: Variable that has not been assigned a value.
6. **Null**: Intentional absence of any object value.
7. **Symbol**: Unique and immutable primitive.

## Dynamic Typing
JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning the same variable can hold different types:
```javascript
let x = 5;       // x is a Number
x = "Hello";     // x is now a String
```
