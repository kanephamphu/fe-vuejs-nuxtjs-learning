# Iterating with Loops

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

## Types of Loops
1. `for`: Standard loop with initializer, condition, and increment.
2. `while`: Runs as long as a condition is true.
3. `for...of`: Iterates over iterable objects (arrays).
4. `for...in`: Iterates over object properties.

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (const color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```
