# Daily Exercise: The Data Type Architect

### 🧩 The Scenario
You are building a high-security user system. You need to choose the correct primitive type for the following pieces of data to ensure maximum performance and security.

### 🛠️ The Challenge
Match the data requirement to the correct JavaScript Primitive:

1. **User Balance**: Must handle decimal precision.
2. **Is Online**: A simple true/false toggle.
3. **Unique System ID**: A value that is guaranteed never to clash with any other key, even if the names are the same.
4. **The "Empty" State**: A variable that has been declared but not yet assigned any value.
