# Primitive Data Types

JavaScript has 7 primitive types. Primitives are immutable and compared by value.

## The Big 7
1. `String`: `"Hello"`
2. `Number`: `42`, `3.14`
3. `Boolean`: `true`, `false`
4. `Undefined`: A variable that has not been assigned a value.
5. `Null`: Intentional absence of value.
6. `Symbol`: Unique and immutable identifier.
7. `BigInt`: Very large integers.

```javascript
let isActive = true;
let total = 100.50;
let message = "Welcome!";
```
