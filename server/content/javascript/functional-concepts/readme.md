# Functional Concepts

JavaScript supports functional programming patterns like Higher-Order Functions.

## Pure Functions
Functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.

## Higher-Order Functions
Functions that take other functions as arguments (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
```
