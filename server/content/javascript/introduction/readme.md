# Variables
## Storing Data
<!-- theme: default -->

We use variables to store data values. Even though we are learning Vue, understanding modern JS is critical.

- \`let\`: For values that change.
- \`const\`: For values that stay the same.
- \`var\`: The old way (Avoid using this!)

# Scope
## Where data lives
<!-- theme: dark -->

Scope determines the visibility of variables.

\`\`\`javascript
{
  let local = "Hidden";
}
// local is not accessible here
\`\`\`

Vue Components take advantage of scope to keep your app organized.
