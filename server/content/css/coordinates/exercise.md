# Exercise: Coordinate Coder

- [x] I understand that `top: 50%` moves the top edge of the element to the middle of its parent.

? Which coordinate property moves an element to the left (from the right edge)? ! right
? What is the shorthand property for top, right, bottom, and left? ! inset

? Valid coordinate units (Multiple Choice):
- [X] px
- [X] %
- [X] rem
- [X] calc(100% - 20px)
- [ ] deg (degrees used for rotation)
