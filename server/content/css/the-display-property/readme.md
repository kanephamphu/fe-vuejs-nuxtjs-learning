# The Display Property

The `display` property determines how an element is rendered and how it interacts with other elements.

## Common Values
- `block`: Starts on a new line and takes full width.
- `inline`: Sits side-by-side; doesn't respect width/height.
- `inline-block`: Sits side-by-side but respects width/height.
- `none`: Completely removes the element from the layout.
- `flex`: Enables Flexbox layout for children.
- `grid`: Enables Grid layout for children.

```css
.nav-item {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
