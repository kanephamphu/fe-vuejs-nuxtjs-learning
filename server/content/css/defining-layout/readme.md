# Defining Layout

Layout is how elements are arranged on a web page. CSS provides several ways to control this.

## Flow Layout
By default, block elements (like `<div>`) stack vertically, and inline elements (like `<span>`) sit side-by-side.

## The Container
Most layouts start with a container that wraps the content.
```html
<div class="container">
  <header>Header</header>
  <main>Main Content</main>
</div>
```

## Modern Layouts
Today, we primarily use **Flexbox** and **Grid** for complex layouts, but understanding the document flow is essential.
