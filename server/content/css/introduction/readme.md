# Layout Systems
## Positioning Elements
<!-- theme: default -->

- **Block**: Takes up the full width (div, p, h1).
- **Inline**: Takes up only necessary width (span, a).
- **Flexbox**: One-dimensional layout.
- **Grid**: Two-dimensional layout.

# The Box Model
## Everything is a box
<!-- theme: dark -->

Every element on a page is a rectangular box containing:
1. **Content**: The text or image.
2. **Padding**: Space INSIDE the border.
3. **Border**: The line around the content.
4. **Margin**: Space OUTSIDE the border.
