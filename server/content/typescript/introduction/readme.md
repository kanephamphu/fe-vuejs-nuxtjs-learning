TypeScript (TS) is JavaScript with syntax for types.

It detects errors in your code **before** you run it, saving you hours of debugging.

# Type Annotations
## Explicit Definitions

We can tell the computer exactly what kind of data we expect.

\`\`\`typescript
let username: string = "Hello";
let age: number = 25;
let isAdmin: boolean = false;
\`\`\`

## Safety & Autocomplete

- **Safety**: You can't accidentally subtract "pizza" from 100.
- **Autocomplete**: Your IDE knows exactly what properties exist on your objects.

Vue 3 is written in TypeScript, so they work perfectly together.
