# Nuxt.js: SSR, SEO, and SSG

Nuxt is a high-level framework that builds on top of Vue to provide powerful features for modern web applications.

## Key Concepts
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**: Pages are rendered on the server, improving SEO and initial load speed.
- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: Built-in components and composables for meta tags.
- **SSG (Static Site Generation)**: Pre-renders your pages at build time for high performance.

## Hybrid Rendering
Nuxt allows you to mix these strategies on a per-page basis!
