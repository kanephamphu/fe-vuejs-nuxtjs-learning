# Auto Imports

One of Nuxt's most magical features is **Auto Imports**. You can use Vue Composition API functions and Nuxt composables anywhere without importing them.

## Standard Vue (Before)
```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue';
import { useRoute } from 'vue-router';

const count = ref(0);
const route = useRoute();
</script>
```

## Nuxt Way (After)
```vue
<script setup>
// No imports needed!
const count = ref(0);
const route = useRoute();
</script>
```

## Directory-Based Auto Imports
Nuxt also automatically imports components and composables from specific directories:

- `components/`: Any component here is available globally.
- `composables/`: Any export from a `.ts` file here is available globally.
- `utils/`: Helper functions exported here are auto-imported.

### Nested Structures
If you have `components/base/Button.vue`, Nuxt can auto-import it as `<BaseButton />` (combining directory names).

> [!TIP]
> This drastically reduces boilerplate code. If you ever need to see exactly what is being imported, check the `.nuxt/imports.d.ts` file generated by Nuxt.
